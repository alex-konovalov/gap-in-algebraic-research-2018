This fundamental and hands-on workshop will enable participants to use GAP in their day-to-day research: One of the key aspects of mathematical research has always been the study of examples to verify, sharpen, or contradict working hypotheses.
In particular when these examples become too time consuming or error-prone for hand computation a computer algebra system such as GAP comes in handy.
Taking it one step further, GAP is also a great platform in which to implement your own specialised algorithms:
It is excellent at integrating them with existing methods, always choosing the "best" available algorithm.

The workshop is aimed at mathematicians who are interested in incorporating GAP into their research and **does not require any prior computational experience**.
Lessons will be live-coding, and the instructors will ensure a friendly working environment.

We will teach the basics of working with GAP as well as more advanced topics. These include debugging, profiling, and automated testing.
One session is reserved to explore topics of special interest to participants.
Apart from the GAP lessons we will cover how to use the terminal and how to use Git to control versions of your code.

In addition to the coding sessions we encourage participants to give short presentations on their research, emphasising possible computational problems.
We will discuss whether and how one can attack these with GAP and which pitfalls to look out for.

The workshop will take place in Aachen, September 17 - 19.
If you wish, you can stay an extra day to work on your own code with our support.
