We will use the framapad
[https://annuel.framapad.org/p/gap2018rwth](https://annuel.framapad.org/p/gap2018rwth)
to share links, snippets of code and to chat.

Slides and exercise materials will be uploaded here during the school.

with exercises that do use Singular. You need to have Singular installed.

## Majorana Algebras - Madeleine Whybrow

Here are the slides:
[slides]({{ site.baseurl }}/materials/Majorana-and-axial-algebras_Slides.pdf).
Here is the problem sheet:
[tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/materials/Majorana-and-axial-algebras_Tutorial.pdf).

If you are feeling confident and have completed the problem sheet (or as much of it as interests you)
then you can have a look at these additional problems:
[extension]({{ site.baseurl }}/materials/Majorana-and-axial-algebras_Extension.pdf).
