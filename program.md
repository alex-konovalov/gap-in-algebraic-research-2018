## Workshop
* Start: Wednesday August 30th at 10 am
* Finish: Friday September 1st afternoon

The focus of the workshop will be on presenting research and development related to GAP. __Please submit proposals__ (e.g., topics you want to see covered, or title of a talk you could give) to the organisers (<gapdays2017-fall@gapdays.de>).

## Code sprint
* Start: Monday September 4th at 10 am
* Finish: Friday September 8th afternoon

The primary focus of the code sprint will be on the following topics:

1. __GAP - HPC-GAP integration__
  - see the [the HPC-GAP TODO wiki page](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/wiki/HPC-GAP-TODO) for specifics
2. __Towards GAP 4.9__
  - work on a release check list (see [this issue](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues/1477))
  - determine what needs to be done before we can release (which issues need to be resolved, which PR be merged, ...?)
  - prepare a list of major/minor changes since GAP 4.8; including the integration of HPC-GAP
  - if possible, prepare the actual release

Some ideas for secondary topics (while we want to focus on primary subjects, people not interested in these can still attend, and work on a secondary subject from this list or based on their own interests):

3. __Data structures in GAP__ (providing stacks, queues, hash sets, hash maps, ...; see also <https://github.com/gap-packages/datastructures>)
4. __MatrixObj__ (continue work from the [previous GAP Days](http://gapdays.de/gapdays2017-spring/10_topic/))
5. __Documentation, Tutorials, Accessibility__ (talk about how to improve them, and ideally also actually do that)
6. __Website__ (we probably need to a completely new one; can we hire somebody to do it? what is needed? etc.)
4. __GAP - Julia integration__ (continue work from [Oscar GAP Kickoff Coding Sprint (restricted access)](https://github.com/oscar-system/OSCAR/wiki/Oscar-GAP-Kickoff-Coding-Sprint))

If you have any suggestions for the code sprint, please let the organisers know or [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues) using the label "gapdays2017-fall".
