## Workshop
* Start: Wednesday August 30th at 10 am
* Finish: Friday September 1st afternoon

The focus of the workshop will be on presenting research and development related to GAP. Please submit your proposal (e.g., topics you want to see covered, title of your talk) to the organisers (<gapdays2017-fall@gapdays.de>).

## Code sprint
* Start: Monday September 4th at 10 am
* Finish: Friday September 8th afternoon

The focus of the code sprint will be on the following topics:

1. __GAP - HPC-GAP integration__ (see also [the HPC-GAP TODO wiki page](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/wiki/HPC-GAP-TODO))
2. __Towards GAP 4.9__
  - work on a release check list (see [this issue](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues/1477))
  - determine what needs to be done before we can release (which issues need to be resolved, which PR be merged, ...?)
  - prepare a list of major/minor changes since GAP 4.8; including the integration of HPC-GAP
  - if possible, prepare the actual release
3. __Data structures in GAP__ (providing stacks, queues, hash sets, hash maps, ...; see also <https://github.com/gap-packages/datastructures>)
4. If there is interest, also __GAP - Julia integration__ (continue work from [Oscar GAP Kickoff Coding Sprint (restricted access)](https://github.com/oscar-system/OSCAR/wiki/Oscar-GAP-Kickoff-Coding-Sprint))

If you have any suggestions for the code sprint, please let the organisers know or [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues) using the label "gapdays2017-fall".
